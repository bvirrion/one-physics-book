"""Indonesian-specific hygiene gate for a translated tree.

check_translation.sh proves *structure*: same files, same labels, same
environment census. Its prose gates prove almost nothing here -- gate 6 looks
for TeX accent escapes, which Indonesian never writes (the orthography is
plain ASCII), and the drafty-"..." gate is script-agnostic. So an Indonesian
tree can pass every existing gate and still be half English.

**Indonesian is the hard case, and it is hard for the opposite reason to
Hindi.** The Devanagari and Arabic gates can flag *any* Latin word in visible
text, because in those editions Latin script is itself the defect. Indonesian
is written in the same alphabet as the English source, so a forgotten
sentence, a forgotten TikZ node or a forgotten \\text{...} is invisible to
that rule. The only safe detector is the inverse: a **curated list of English
words that are not also Indonesian words**, plus a density heuristic for
sentences that were never touched at all.

This is the One Physics Book copy. It is the math book's gate plus a
physics block in each list (marked "physics" below): the subject changes
which English words a forgotten sentence leaves behind, and it changes which
words are ordinary Indonesian. The loudest example is "air", which is
Indonesian for WATER and appears on nearly every page of Book 1 -- gating the
English word "air" would make the gate unusable here.

Every entry in ENGLISH_WORDS below was checked against Indonesian. Words that
are spelled identically in both languages are deliberately absent and listed
in NOT_GATED with the reason -- "data", "total", "real", "ring", "limit",
"integral", "unit", "area", "set", "median", "mode" are ordinary Indonesian
and flagging them would make the gate unusable.

Failure classes this script detects:

  1. `english`      -- a listed English word in visible text: prose, TikZ node
                       text, \\text{...} inside math, chapter/section titles,
                       environment optional titles, \\index keys.
  2. `untranslated` -- a long visible sentence containing not one of the
                       commonest Indonesian function words. An Indonesian
                       sentence of eight words essentially always contains a
                       "yang", "dan", "di", "dari", "untuk", "adalah", ...;
                       one that does not was never translated.
  3. `math-space`   -- MT-injected spaces inside inline math ("$P $ dan $ Q $"),
                       detected by the shared reduction.
  4. `redup-space`  -- plural reduplication written with spaces around the
                       hyphen ("bilangan - bilangan"). Invisible in print,
                       fatal to the term linker's word boundaries.
  5. `enclitic`     -- the enclitic -nya written as a separate word
                       ("turunan nya"), which is not Indonesian and again
                       breaks term matching.
  6. `split-number` -- a thin space splitting a word from a thousands group
                       ("bilangan\\,000"), the class that damaged Hindi when
                       MT moved a number out of "Numbers up to 10\\,000".

The LaTeX reduction is imported from tools/check_hindi_prose.py rather than
copied: it is language-independent (it drops technical macro arguments, keeps
\\text{...} inside math, pulls visible strings out of tikz/pgfplots drawing
code) and one implementation is better than three.

Usage:
    python3 tools/check_indonesian_prose.py parts/grade-3/id parts/grade-3/solutions/id
    python3 tools/check_indonesian_prose.py --quiet <dir> ...

Exit status is 1 if anything was flagged. Called by check_translation.sh for
lang == id; safe to run by hand on a single directory while translating.
